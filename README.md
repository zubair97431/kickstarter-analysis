As shown in the line graph below, it appears that May and June were the best times to launch the Theater campaigns however it is not recommended in Decemeber.

For her to reach her goals, I reccomend that Louise should stick to plays in the US and aim for mid-year as close as possible to May and June. This is peak time for reaping the benefits of campaigning.
